Hi, I'm Ty Pederson, I'm currently finishing up my junior year as a 
computer science major with a concentration in graphics and game design
at Louisiana Tech University
I have a passion for video games and am working my way to be a part of the game design industry.
I am currently working on learning Unity on the side as I continue with my classes.

I have taken part in many group projects in my computer science classes, 
one of which being a quarter-long 2,100-line game written in python. 
The game can actually be seen here in my github, its called CSC-132-FinalPyProject.

I've taken several different courses throughout my time here at Louisiana Tech, including
CSC 130-132 (Louisiana Tech's Living with Cyber series)   Learned the basics of object-oriented programming throughout these courses in python
CSC 220 Data Structures               Learned about data structures such as stacks, queues, priority queues, trees, and heaps using java
CSC 222 Systems Programming           Learned some basic linux, how programs are executed in an operating system, and some parallel processing using C
CSC 265 Intro to Digital Design       Learned about several different kinds of logic gates, finite-state-machines, and things such as 
                                      JK/T/D flip-flops using python
CSC 310 Theory of Computing           Learned about regular languages, push-down automata, context-free languages, and turing machines
CSC 325 Computer Architecture         Learned how an operating system does basic operations a machine language and physical level, also using a custom version
                                      of assembly witten in python by Dr. Ben Choi
CSC 330 Programming Languages         Learned about different programming paradigms using ML for functional paradigm, Prolog for logical paradigm, 
                                      and MatLab for procedural paradigm
CSC 345 Operating Systems             Learned about how an operating system works and how it incorperates all pieces of it's hardware to function using C
CSC 364 Advanced Data Structures      Learned about more data structures but mostly focused on learning different algorithms such as merge sort using python
CSC 430 Database Management           Learned about how to create an EER then how to create a database from an EER using mySQL, along with queries, functional 
                                      dependencies, and indexing structures
